// [NBOSP_TRUST-STORE_JS] -- from NovaByte OS Platform (NBOSP), not NovaPack Studio
/**
 * NovaByte - Trust Store
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A small, explicit list of public keys NBOSP trusts to vouch for app
 * packages, analogous to a browser's shipped root CA list. Each entry
 * holds ONLY a public key — never a secret — so shipping this file to
 * every install is safe: it lets installs *verify* signatures, it can
 * never let anyone *forge* one.
 *
 * Where entries come from:
 *  - "NovaByte Trusted Signing" is the built-in signing authority run by
 *    NovaByte. Developers who want the "Trusted" badge submit their
 *    package to that authority (see NovaPack Studio's signing flow),
 *    which reviews it and signs it with a private key ONLY NovaByte
 *    holds, offline. This file ships the matching public key.
 *  - Additional partner/enterprise CAs can be appended the same way if
 *    NovaByte ever delegates trust to other signing authorities.
 *  - Individual developers can still self-sign (createPackage with a
 *    signingKey) for their own testing, but self-signed packages will
 *    not match anything in this trust store, so they'll always surface
 *    as "Unverified" to end users — which is correct: nobody but the
 *    developer themselves vouches for a self-signed app.
 *
 * NOTE on the key below: this is a real public key, not a placeholder.
 * It corresponds to NovaByte's own private signing key, held offline
 * and never distributed to developers — that's what the "Verified"
 * badge means for a stock/NovaByte-signed install (see the README's
 * Security section).
 *
 * Swapping it out: if your fork isn't licensed for NovaByte Services,
 * this key is yours to replace like any other trust store entry —
 * point it at your own offline signing key and your fork's "Verified"
 * badge will mean packages reviewed and signed by you instead. The
 * key only has to stay as-is (unmodified, unremoved, still checked)
 * if your fork is NovaByte Services-licensed — see below.
 *
 * This file is part of NBOSP itself (Apache 2.0) — it's bundled in
 * every clone and fork, no separate license needed to have it or fork
 * it as-is.
 *
 * The one condition: if your fork wants a NovaByte Services license
 * (see the README's Licensing section — this covers Nova Core
 * Services, NovaBridge, Sentinel, and the other bundled components),
 * this check — verifying package signatures against the trust store —
 * has to stay intact: not removed, not bypassed, not turned into a
 * no-op, and the NovaByte key above has to stay the one it verifies
 * against. We won't issue a NovaByte Services license to a fork where
 * this has been altered, because a fork that hands out "Trusted"
 * badges to unreviewed/unsigned packages breaks verification for
 * users and for us. Forking NBOSP without a NovaByte Services license
 * is unaffected either way — do what you want with your fork,
 * including swapping this key for your own; this condition only bites
 * if you also want that license.
 *
 * Revocation:
 *  - A signature can be individually revoked without touching the signing
 *    key itself or any other package ever signed. Revocation is keyed by
 *    the exact signature string on the package (pkg.signature), not by
 *    app id/name/version — those are dev-controlled fields a bad actor
 *    could reuse or spoof; the signature is a fixed, unforgeable value
 *    produced once at sign time, so it's the only safe revocation key.
 *  - Revoking a signature does NOT revoke the signing key. Every other
 *    package ever signed with that key remains trusted. This is
 *    deliberately narrow — the whole point is to avoid "one bad app means
 *    distrust everything NovaByte has ever signed."
 *  - If the signing key itself is compromised (the actual key leaks),
 *    revoking individual signatures here is NOT sufficient — that
 *    scenario requires removing/replacing the trust store entry itself
 *    (see `list()`/`add()`) and re-signing everything with a new key.
 *    Revocation here only covers "this one specific app turned out bad,"
 *    not "the key itself is no longer trustworthy."
